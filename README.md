## Getting Started

**Note**: After clone the project on your local machine,run the installation dependencies command with :  ``` npm install ```

First, launch both fake API and angular server with :

npm start
``
After that,
Open `http://localhost:4200/`. with your browser to see the result.

```

## APPLICATION ACCESS
As we can use the real API for fetch the access role for every users which want to use the app, we have been created some users statically in the code (authentication.service.ts) to authenticate and enter the application

The application shows some features denied to the students while an instructor has the rights to its features. The DataBase is the file db.json

We could not complete the feature for updating users but we know that the app can have even more improvement !
